# Technical challenge @ Material-UI
This challenge is part of the hiring process at Material-UI for the Intern Software Engineer position. The idea is to make as much progress as possible under a given time constraint (2 hours).

## Context

In the long term, Material-UI is on a mission to make building great React UIs and web applications quicker, simpler, and accessible to more people through low-code solutions. We resonate with this vision: https://youtu.be/GnO7D5UaDig?t=2451.
